      Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects

      During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects
      for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of DS1 Superlaser in O BBY bay annihilating
      Alderaan - a terrestial class planet in the Core Worlds Region. Succesfully tripled de deep space firepower of
      the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarckin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon
      torpedoes.
